    <h1>Game of War</h1>
    <h2>The Deal</h2>
    <p>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.</p>
    <h2>The Play</h2>
    <p>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.</p>
    <p>If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles. If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another 3 cards face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all cards on the board, and so on.</p>
    <p>In the event that War is declared and either player has fewer than 4 cards, they will place the remaining cards face down until they have 1 left to play face up. In the event that a player's final card ends in a draw, the player with no cards in their hand loses by default.</p>
